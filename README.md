Context:
-each question has 4 answer option, answer 1 will add1 point to the score, answer2 will add 2 points and so on.

Bugs to fix:

-radio btn bug where if i click on oneanswer option and press next the next question has the same option selected but won't register the input on click of next

-radio btn bug 2: if I select answer option 1 it registers 1 point increase on my score but if I change my mind and select answer option number 2 and click next my score thus far will be 3 not 2 .
